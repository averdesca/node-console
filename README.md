# Node Console (based on Webkit Agent)

## Fork

This node module is based on [node-webkit-agent](https://github.com/c4milo/node-webkit-agent) from Camilo Aguilar and WebKit Development Tools.
The front-end code is slightly modified to provide only remote "Console" feature with:  
* multiple front-ends connections  
* node-to-frontend logging  
* auto re-attach support on node process restart  
* programmatically define custom ports to avoid conflicts  

_The agent must be loaded inside the node process you want to control. If you pause runtime through breakpoints and debugger, the console will not work (use the inspector one)._



## ToDo

The console.dir doesn't work properly and logs string representation instead of navigable object.



## Example
```javascript  
var web_console = require('node-console');  
web_console.start(9090, 9999, 3333, '0.0.0.0');  

[...]  

web_console.stop();  
```
